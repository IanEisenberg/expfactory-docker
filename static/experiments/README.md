This is the django "media" folder, meaning that files can be dyanmically added/subtracted from here (eg, the experiments) served from the url "static." This is not to be confused with the "static" files directory for the django app, which is under "assets." This was done because the experiment folders are added dynamically and need to be found on the application, and are not associated with any of the django installed apps (experiments,main,or turk).
